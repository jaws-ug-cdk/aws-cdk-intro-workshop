If you have not, and just want to follow this segment, or you are returning to try this workshop, you can use the code here that represents the last state of the project after adding the tests.
Create Pipeline Stack The first step is to create the stack that will contain our pipeline. Since this is separate from our actual &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; application, we want this to be entirely self-contained.</description></item><item><title>Create Repository</title><link>https://jaws-ug-cdk.github.io/aws-cdk-intro-workshop/40-dotnet/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/2000-create-repo.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaws-ug-cdk.github.io/aws-cdk-intro-workshop/40-dotnet/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/2000-create-repo.html</guid><description>Create Repo in Pipeline Stack The first step in any good CD pipeline is source control. Here we will create a CodeCommit repository to contain our project code.
Edit the file CdkWorkshop/PipelineStack.cs as follows.
using Amazon.CDK; using Amazon.CDK.AWS.CodeCommit; using Constructs namespace CdkWorkshop { public class WorkshopPipelineStack : Stack { public WorkshopPipelineStack(Construct parent, string id, IStackProps props = null) : base(parent, id, props) { // Creates a CodeCommit repository called &amp;#39;WorkshopRepo&amp;#39; var repo = new Repository(this, &amp;#34;WorkshopRepo&amp;#34;, new RepositoryProps { RepositoryName = &amp;#34;WorkshopRepo&amp;#34; }); // Pipeline code goes here } } } Deploy Now we can deploy the app to see our new repo.</description></item><item><title>Create New Pipeline</title><link>https://jaws-ug-cdk.github.io/aws-cdk-intro-workshop/40-dotnet/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/3000-new-pipeline.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaws-ug-cdk.github.io/aws-cdk-intro-workshop/40-dotnet/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/3000-new-pipeline.html</guid><description>Define an Empty Pipeline Now we are ready to define the basics of the pipeline.
Return to the file CdkWorkshop/PipelineStack.cs and edit as follows:
using Amazon.CDK; using Amazon.CDK.AWS.CodeCommit; using Amazon.CDK.AWS.CodePipeline; using Amazon.CDK.AWS.CodePipeline.Actions; using Amazon.CDK.Pipelines; using Constructs; namespace CdkWorkshop { public class WorkshopPipelineStack : Stack { public WorkshopPipelineStack(Construct parent, string id, IStackProps props = null) : base(parent, id, props) { // Creates a CodeCommit repository called &amp;#39;WorkshopRepo&amp;#39; var repo = new Repository(this, &amp;#34;WorkshopRepo&amp;#34;, new RepositoryProps { RepositoryName = &amp;#34;WorkshopRepo&amp;#34; }); // The basic pipeline declaration.</description></item><item><title>Add Application to Pipeline</title><link>https://jaws-ug-cdk.github.io/aws-cdk-intro-workshop/40-dotnet/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/4000-build-stage.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaws-ug-cdk.github.io/aws-cdk-intro-workshop/40-dotnet/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/4000-build-stage.html</guid><description>Create Stage At this point, you have a fully operating CDK pipeline that will automatically update itself on every commit, BUT at the moment, that is all it does. We need to add a stage to the pipeline that will deploy our application.
Create a new file in CdkWorkshop called PipelineStage.cs with the code below:
using Amazon.CDK; using Amazon.CDK.Pipelines; using Constructs; namespace CdkWorkshop { public class WorkshopPipelineStage : Stage { public WorkshopPipelineStage(Construct scope, string id, StageProps props = null) : base(scope, id, props) { var service = new CdkWorkshopStack(this, &amp;#34;WebService&amp;#34;); } } } All this does is declare a new Stage (component of a pipeline), and in that stage instantiate our application stack.</description></item><item><title>Polish Pipeline</title><link>https://jaws-ug-cdk.github.io/aws-cdk-intro-workshop/40-dotnet/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/5000-test-actions.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaws-ug-cdk.github.io/aws-cdk-intro-workshop/40-dotnet/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/5000-test-actions.html</guid><description>Get Endpoints Stepping back, we can see a problem now that our app is being deployed by our pipeline. There is no easy way to find the endpoints of our application (the TableViewer and APIGateway endpoints), so we can&amp;rsquo;t call it! Let&amp;rsquo;s add a little bit of code to expose these more obviously.
First edit CdkWorkshop/CdkWorkshopStack.cs to get these values and expose them as properties of our stack:
