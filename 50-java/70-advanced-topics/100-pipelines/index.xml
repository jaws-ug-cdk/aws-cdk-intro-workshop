If you have not, and just want to follow this segment, or you are returning to try this workshop, you can use the code here that represents the last state of the project after adding the tests.
Create Pipeline Stack The first step is to create the stack that will contain our pipeline. Since this is separate from our actual &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; application, we want this to be entirely self-contained.</description></item><item><title>Create Repository</title><link>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/2000-create-repo.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/2000-create-repo.html</guid><description>Create Repo in Pipeline Stack The first step in any good CD pipeline is source control. Here we will create a CodeCommit repository to contain our project code.
Edit the file WorkshopPipelineStack.java as follows.
package com.myorg; import software.constructs.Construct; import software.amazon.awscdk.Stack; import software.amazon.awscdk.StackProps; import software.amazon.awscdk.services.codecommit.Repository; public class WorkshopPipelineStack extends Stack { public WorkshopPipelineStack(final Construct parent, final String id) { this(parent, id, null); } public WorkshopPipelineStack(final Construct parent, final String id, final StackProps props) { super(parent, id, props); // This creates a new CodeCommit repository called &amp;#39;WorkshopRepo&amp;#39; final Repository repo = Repository.</description></item><item><title>Create New Pipeline</title><link>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/3000-new-pipeline.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/3000-new-pipeline.html</guid><description>Define an Empty Pipeline Now we are ready to define the basics of the pipeline.
Return to the file WorkshopPipelineStack.java and edit as follows:
package com.myorg; import java.util.List; import java.util.Map; import software.constructs.Construct; import software.amazon.awscdk.Stack; import software.amazon.awscdk.StackProps; import software.amazon.awscdk.pipelines.CodeBuildStep; import software.amazon.awscdk.pipelines.CodePipeline; import software.amazon.awscdk.pipelines.CodePipelineSource; import software.amazon.awscdk.services.codecommit.Repository; import software.amazon.awscdk.services.codepipeline.actions.CodeCommitSourceAction; public class WorkshopPipelineStack extends Stack { public WorkshopPipelineStack(final Construct parent, final String id) { this(parent, id, null); } public WorkshopPipelineStack(final Construct parent, final String id, final StackProps props) { super(parent, id, props); // This creates a new CodeCommit repository called &amp;#39;WorkshopRepo&amp;#39; final Repository repo = Repository.</description></item><item><title>Add Application to Pipeline</title><link>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/4000-build-stage.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/4000-build-stage.html</guid><description>Create Stage At this point, you have a fully operating CodePipeline that will automatically update itself on every commit, BUT at the moment, that is all it does. We need to add a stage to the pipeline that will deploy our application.
Create a new file in CdkWorkshop called WorkshopPipelineStage.java with the code below:
package com.myorg; import software.amazon.awscdk.Stage; import software.constructs.Construct; import software.amazon.awscdk.StageProps; public class WorkshopPipelineStage extends Stage { public WorkshopPipelineStage(final Construct scope, final String id) { this(scope, id, null); } public WorkshopPipelineStage(final Construct scope, final String id, final StageProps props) { super(scope, id, props); new CdkWorkshopStack(this, &amp;#34;WebService&amp;#34;); } } All this does is declare a new Stage (component of a pipeline), and in that stage instantiate our application stack.</description></item><item><title>Polish Pipeline</title><link>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/5000-test-actions.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/5000-test-actions.html</guid><description>Get Endpoints Stepping back, we can see a problem now that our app is being deployed by our pipeline. There is no easy way to find the endpoints of our application (the TableViewer and APIGateway endpoints), so we can&amp;rsquo;t call it! Let&amp;rsquo;s add a little bit of code to expose these more obviously.
First edit CdkWorkshopStack.java to get these values and expose them as properties of our stack:
package com.myorg; import io.</description></item><item><title>Cleanup</title><link>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/6000-cleanup.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cdkworkshop.com/50-java/70-advanced-topics/100-pipelines/6000-cleanup.html</guid><description>To clean up the stacks from this workshop, navigate to the Cloudformation Console, select your stacks, and hit &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo;. This may take some time.</description></item></channel></rss>
